# Real-World-Project-
A real world solution to universities' attendance systems

With plastic becoming a real world problem that affects the environment, the United Kingdom
has already launched a plan in 2018 to ban plastic straws[1].

Another factor of consideration is that UK's major waste importer, China, has banned foreign
garbage imports [2]. 

Transport for London, the local government body for the transport system in London is also moving
towards a contactless form of payment, when it started accepting contactless cards and mobile
payments instead of the normal Oyster Cards [3]. 

Coventry University still uses student ID cards made of plastic. We create a contactless solution
available on student's smartphones for an alternative attendance system.
